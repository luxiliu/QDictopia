QDictopia is an edition of sdcv/stardict on Qtopia Open Source 4.3.1. It uses sdcv's lib for word lookup and Qt for GUI.

-------------------
1.	Build & Install

	# QTOPIABUILDDIR/bin/qtopiamake
	# make & make install


2.	Dictionary files

	Dictionary files used by QDictopia are from StarDict. By default, it locates in "/usr/share/stardict/dic/". For one dictionary, it includes four types of file: *.dict.dz, *.idx, *.oft, and *.ifo. You could put your own dictionary file in this directory or modify DIC_PATH in the souce code.


3. 	Fonts

	QDictopia uses Wen Quan Yi font.. You could find it in "http://wqy.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/enindex.cgi". And I use "wqy-unibit" font because Qtopia is unicode based. Put the font file "wqy-unibit.bdf" in the tarball to "$QPEDIR/lib/fonts/". Append a line in the file "$QPEDIR/lib/fonts/fontdir" with following:
	
	wenquanyi wqy-unibit.bdf FT n 75 160 s

	Then in the file "$QPEDIR/etc/default/Trolltech/qpe.conf", modify:

	[Font]
	FontFamily[]=wenquanyi
	FontSize[]=6.4

	Restart Qtopia, then you will see a different font is used.
